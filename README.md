Correctness of Selection Sort:

Selection Sort is a simple yet effective sorting algorithm that operates by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning. Let's examine its correctness through loop invariants.

Initialization:
At the start of each iteration, the section of the array before the current position is already sorted. Initially, this holds true since the entire array is the unsorted portion.

Maintenance:
After each pass, the minimum element from the unsorted portion is selected and placed in its correct position in the sorted portion. The order of the remaining elements in the sorted region remains unchanged. Consequently, with each iteration, one element is added to the sorted portion, and one is removed from the unsorted region.

Termination:
The algorithm concludes when the entire array is sorted, indicated by an empty unsorted region. At this point, the correctness is preserved as the complete array is sorted.

Example:
```python
a = [9, 3, 12, 4, 6]
selection_sort_implementation(a)
print("Array after sorting using Selection Sort:", a)
# Output: [3, 4, 6, 9, 12]
The provided snippet represents the Selection Sort algorithm, where the search and swapping of the smallest element are performed. The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N^2), making it less efficient for large datasets. Despite its quadratic time complexity, Selection Sort remains a viable option for smaller datasets due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.
